# TRI-mapping CV NN dynamic data manipulation utility

This project is to help facilitate the data collected in research lab in different format.
TRI-mapping allows event synchronization between vehicle OBD data .csv to MATLAB file and interchangable format
There are five mapping function in this project

## mapLCevent

Allow user to map LC CV detect result to ground truth labeled video xls file

## mapTripEvent

Allow user to map on-road dynamic event to OBD data .csv and finalize in .mat file

## mapEventDetect

Allow user to map the matlab nntool on-road dynamic event detection result to video frame

## mapWLE2TRI

Allow user to synchronize WLE project data to TRI data for research work.

## mapCVNNResult

Allow user to synchronize result from mapTripEvent
