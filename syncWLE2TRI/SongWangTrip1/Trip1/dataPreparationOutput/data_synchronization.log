From now on we perform normality check to physiological signal...
ECG signal has 647 setup errors, and 0 sample(s) out of range
HR  signal has 0 setup errors, and 0 sample(s) out of range
HRV signal has 342 setup errors, and 0 sample(s) out of range
BR  signal has 0 setup errors, and 0 sample(s) out of range
abnormality check completed! abnormal samples have been located
hrv abnormality happens at the beginning, the 1st to the 342th HRV samples have been removed
successfully remove abnormality from ecg and hrv, other signals do not have abnormality in the commom time interval of ecg and hrv
successfully aligned signals in summary of Bioharness in time (due to abnormal samples of ecg and hav have been removed)
successfully locate the commom time inverval of all signals (from shimmer, bioharness, obd)
successfully remove physiological signal samples out of the common time interval
successfully remove 3 recorded events due to out of common time interval
